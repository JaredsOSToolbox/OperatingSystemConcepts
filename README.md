# OS-Toolbox

Tools and Projects for CS 351 (McCarthy)
I recreated the VM [originally linked here](https://www.os-book.com/OS10/index.html), because a headless instance of Ubuntu sucks.

**Note:** this is an archived version of the original repository.
Please refer to commit `d6e24fae80d9911019fbb7bf0b86acdd4b823fc1` to what it looked like before.
